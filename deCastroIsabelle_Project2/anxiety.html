	Harper Calligaris-
	
	Hi my name is Harper Calligaris. I’m a 17-year old girl who is on Student Council, 
	the JV volleyball team, Model UN, and National Honor Society. <div3 class="harperstill"><div4 class="harperhover"> On the outside,</div4></div3>
	I’m very happy, <div5 class="harperstill"><div6 class="harperhover">but in reality, I struggle with severe anxiety.</div6></div5>

	Life has <div7 class="harperstill"><div8 class="harperhover">not</div8></div7> been easy for me. Ever since I started high school, I’ve been 
	<div9 class="harperstill"><div10 class="harperhover">getting more and more anxious about fitting in with my friends and acting like 
	I’ve been </div10></div9>having the best time.

	I <div11 class="harperstill"><div12 class="harperhover">wish I could break down these walls and </div12></div11>talk to my friends about everything. 
	I love my friends, <div13 class="harperstill"><div14 class="harperhover">but I’m constantly worried about what they think of me even 
	though </div14></div13>we’ve been friends for so long.

	I’m going to talk to them today. <div15 class="harperstill"><div16 class="harperhover">My mom told me it’s better to break down the walls 
	instead of hide behind them. </div16></div15>I’m <div17 class="harperstill"><div18 class="harperhover">nervous, but I want to be able to get through this,
	and I’ll need the support of others to do that. That way, I can finally start being 
	myself and feeling </div18></div17>happy <div19 class="harperstill"><div20 class="harperhover">again.</div20></div19></pre></div2> </div>
